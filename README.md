# password manager
password manager is a program that (can you  guess?) manages passwords.
you can add passwords, delete passwords, see passwords... well that's about it
so what makes this program worth your time?

for starters it's real simple to use and it's real simple to get information if you are lost!

but most important it's safe. 
every time you add a password you choose a decryption key which is used to encrypt your password,
the password will then encrypted and will be stored in it's encrypted state!
it means no one can figure out your password without the decryption key, not even if
someone is able to look at the file storing the passwords or even at the code

the encryption is made using the Fernet encryption from the python cryptography library

to make it work you have to download the password_manager directory and start
password_manager.py inside the folder, the rest will be explained within the program
